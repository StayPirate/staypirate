                Computer fanatic. The trait I love most about myself is curiosity.
                Thanks to this, from the age of eight I've experimented, first, and then studied everything I could about computer science.
                Its incredible complexity never stops giving us ever-growing opportunity to understand how computers work.
                It's obvious that I quickly became addicted to GNU/Linux and open source softwares:
                I felt, and still do feel, the need to know exactly what happens inside my &ndash;and maybe your&ndash; computer.<br />
                A never-stop-learning attitude let me improve myself every day.
                My grandfather used to say: "If at the end of the day you realize that you've learned something new,
                even a simple thing that a day earlier you didn't know, then you didn't waste your day".
                Since he's gone, I've been trying to put that into practice and never let a day pass by without having expanded my knowledge.
                Hopefully, one day I'll turn into a man as great as he was.

                <p>
                    My thesis shows how easy it is to achieve remote control of a personal computer, even if it runs Windows, GNU/Linux or macOS. This method aims to
                    intercept and parse traffic of one or more end systems, looking for executable codes. If found, the transparent proxy injects the malware before
                    it reaches the end system. <br />
                    That means you can securely download a legitimate executable from a trusted server, and the backdoor will be added during transmission.
